Hello, I'm Vladi and I'm starting my path in the Data Analysis field, after studying for several months I'm happy to share my first project.

The "Games analysis" project is done in Python in Jupyter Notebook, I used several libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy etc.

The project contains all the major steps: The task itself, data and metadata studying, data preprocessing, EDA, hypothesis testing, and conclusions. Each step has its conclusions to keep up
